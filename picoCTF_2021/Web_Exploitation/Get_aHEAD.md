## Description

Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition http://mercury.picoctf.net:47967/

## Hints

- Maybe you have more than 2 choices
- Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your requests and look at the responses

## Analysis

The website offers a simple choice between Red and Blue, which use standard web requests (GET/POST). The challenge title, "GET aHEAD," is a hint pointing us to a different, less-common web request method: the HEAD method. The server is designed to hide the flag in the response headers when it receives a HEAD request, bypassing the normal website functionality.

## Methodology
**Step 1:** **Analyze the Request Behavior** Open the website. 
When you view the source or inspect the network tab in your browser (F12), you see a form. Usually, web forms use `GET` or `POST`. The challenge is trying to lock you into this binary choice (Red vs. Blue).

Choose Red - Method `GET`

Choose Blue - Method `POST`

**Step 2:** **Choose the Tool (cURL)** To solve this, we need to send a specific HTTP request that the browser doesn't send by default when clicking buttons. We will use **cURL**, a command-line tool used to transfer data. It is perfect for this because it allows us to specify the "Verb" (the method) of the request easily.


**Step 3:** **Execute the HEAD Request** We will send a `HEAD` request to the target URL. In cURL, the `-I` (capital i) flag is used to fetch the HTTP-header only (which implies a HEAD request).

## Flag

picoCTF{r3j---------bd3}

## Reflection

This challenge teaches us that web security often relies on the user interface, but the actual protocol has more options. We learned that the HTTP protocol includes methods other than GET and POST, and using tools like cURL allows us to interact directly with the server using any method. The flag was hidden in the metadata (headers), which are usually ignored by the browser.

## Tools

cURL: Used to send the targeted HEAD request.

Terminal/Command Line: The environment for executing cURL.
