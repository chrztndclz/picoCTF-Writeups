## Description
There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:39698/. Can you find it?

---

## Hints
You should have enough hints to find the files, don't run a brute forcer.

---

## Analysis
Based on the challenge description, the goal is to explore the website and uncover hidden pieces of information that form the flag. Since this falls under _Web Exploitation_, it likely involves examining the page source, linked files, and common web directories. The presence of hints about “hidden information” suggests that the flag parts are embedded in files or other server-related files . Therefore, the first approach should be to inspect the site’s code and accessible resources rather than running any brute-force tools.

## Methodology

**Step 1:** Open the site in a browser

Visit `http://mercury.picoctf.net:39698/` in your browser.


Step 2: Inspect the HTML source
Use **View Page Source** or the browser inspector. Look for comments and hidden text.

We got the first part of the flag.

Step 3: Check linked CSS files
Open the site’s CSS (e.g., `mycss.css`) in the inspector or by loading the stylesheet URL directly. Look for comments or text embedded in the CSS:


<img width="1843" height="801" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df43f1ea-8e49-4ae8-bc08-6758d9b44329" />

We got the second part of the flag.

Step 4: Use the Debugger / Inspector for more hints

Examine console messages, script files, and other resources. One comment suggested investigating site indexing (a clue to check `robots.txt`).

Step 5: Request `robots.txt`
Use `curl` or your browser to fetch `robots.txt`:


<img width="551" height="138" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70815e93-17e2-48a1-81f2-2a8ee7eb1038" />

We got the third part of the flag.

Step 6: Look for server configuration files
The site and clues hinted at Apache configuration. Inspect common server files or directories (e.g., `.htaccess`) which may be accessible or referenced.

Use `curl` or your browser to fetch `.htaccess`:

<img width="612" height="99" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90b45b53-07da-4fd4-8ace-76329d661ca4" />


We got the forth part of the flag.

Step 7: Search for platform-specific artifacts
The page mentioned Mac usage; check for macOS artifacts such as `.DS_Store` in accessible directories

Use `curl` or your browser to fetch `.DS_Store`:


<img width="444" height="94" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e0edd70-83db-4af8-9119-db9120ba6a4a" />


We got the fifth part of the flag.

Step 8: Assemble the flag

## Reflection
This challenge is a good example of OSINT-style web enumeration on a small scale: flags are often left in places developers forget to clean up—HTML comments, CSS comments, server configuration files, and platform artifacts like `.DS_Store`. The exercise reinforces careful, methodical inspection with browser developer tools and simple HTTP requests. Start with the visible page, then progressively examine linked resources and server-exposed files; small textual hints often point directly to the next location.

## Tools

Browser developer tools (Inspector, View Source, Debugger)

`curl` or `wget` for fetching files (e.g., `robots.txt`)
