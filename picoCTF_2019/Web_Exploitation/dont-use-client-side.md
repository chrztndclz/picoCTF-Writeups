Can you break into this super secure portal? http://fickle-tempest.picoctf.net:51258

## Hints
- Never trust the client

---

## Analysis

This challenge revolves around **client-side validation**, where the password checking logic is fully visible inside the HTML/JavaScript. Because the verification happens in the browser, not the server, we can inspect the source to reconstruct the correct flag. This type of vulnerability is a common mistake in insecure web applications.

## Methodology

**Step 1:** View Source Code

**Step 2:** Identify the password-checking logic

Inside the HTML, a `<script>` tag reveals a function `verify()` that checks specific **substrings** of the password.
 
**Step 3:** Go to debugger tab to find the md5.js file

Step 4: Extract each required substring

## Reflection

This challenge highlights a common security mistake: relying on **client-side validation** for authentication. Anything executed in the browser can be viewed, modified, or bypassed by the user. Sensitive logic, such as password checking, must always be implemented on the server side. This exercise reinforces the importance of understanding how to inspect and interpret JavaScript in web exploitation challenges.
