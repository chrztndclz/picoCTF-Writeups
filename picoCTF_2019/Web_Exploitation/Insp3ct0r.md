## Description
Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:41511


---

## Hints
- How do you inspect web code on a browser?
- There's 3 parts

---

## Analysis
Based on the description and hints, this challenge requires inspecting the source code of the website. The flag is split into **three parts**, which can typically be found in the main files that make up a website:

1. **HTML** – page structure
    
2. **CSS** – styling rules
    
3. **JavaScript** – behavior and logic
    
We'll inspect each of these to uncover all parts of the flag.

---

## Methodology
**Step 1:** Open the provided website link.

**Step 2:** Right-click anywhere on the page and select **“Inspect”** (or press `Ctrl + Shift + I`) to open the browser’s developer tools.

**Step 3:** In the **Inspector tab** (HTML source), use `Ctrl + F` to search for keywords such as **“flag”** or **“picoCTF”**.

- You’ll find the **first part** of the flag here.

**Step 4:** Next, go to the **Style Editor** tab to view the CSS file.

- Use `Ctrl + F` again to search for the same keywords.
    
- You’ll find the **second part** of the flag in the CSS file.

**Step 5:** Finally, go to the **Debugger** tab to view the JavaScript file(s).

- Use `Ctrl + F` and search again.
    
- You’ll find the **third part** of the flag in the JS file.

**Step 6:** Combine all three flag parts to form the complete flag.

## Flag

First Part:
Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{---------

Second Part:
You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here's part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve---------ju5t 

Third Flag:
Javascript sure is neat. Anyways part 3/3 of the flag: --------699} 

Combined:
picoCTF{tru----------699}

## Reflection
This challenge demonstrates the importance of exploring a website’s **client-side code** — the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — to uncover hidden information. In real-world web security, sensitive data should never be stored or exposed directly in front-end code. The challenge also helps build familiarity with browser developer tools, which are essential for web exploitation and debugging.

---

## Tools

- **Browser Developer Tools (Inspect Element)** – Allows users to view and analyze the structure, style, and scripts of a webpage.
    
- **Ctrl + F (Find)** – Useful for quickly searching for specific keywords like “flag” or “picoCTF” within source files.
