## Description

Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is? cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}

---

## Hints

This can be solved online if you don't want to do it by hand!

---

## Analysis

The given text looks like a typical ROT13-encoded string. ROT13 (Rotate by 13) shifts each letter 13 positions in the alphabet. Applying ROT13 twice returns the original message, which makes it a common challenge in beginner CTF cryptography.

## Methodology
Step 1:** Copy the encryption

**Step 2:** Use a converter such as **CyberChef**.

Tools like **CyberChef** can decode ROT13 instantly.

**Step 4:**  In CyberChef:

Paste the encrypted text into the input field.
Add the operation **ROT13** to the Recipe.
