## Hints
- Sometimes, the most important information is hidden in plain sight. Have you checked all parts of the webpage?
- Cookies aren't just for eating - they're also used in web technologies!
- Web browsers often have tools that can help you inspect various aspects of a webpage, including things you can't see directly.

## Analysis

This challenge revolves around understanding how websites use cookies to store hidden or sensitive data. The hints point toward inspecting browser storage and recognizing that encoded values—especially those that look like Base64—may contain the secret the challenge is asking for.

## Methodology

Step 1: Visit the challenge website and inspect the page source to check if anything is being revealed directly in the HTML.

Step 2: Since the hints mention cookies, open Developer Tools → Application (or Storage) → Cookies to examine all stored values.

Step 3: Try logging in using simple credentials like admin to see if new cookies appear or existing ones change.

Step 4: Notice a cookie named secret_recipe, whose value appears Base64-encoded and therefore suspicious.

Step 5: Copy the cookie value and decode it using CyberChef’s "From Base64" operation to reveal the flag.

## Reflection

This challenge highlights how easily sensitive data can end up exposed through poorly handled cookies. By simply inspecting the browser’s storage, it became clear that the “secret recipe” was stored client-side and merely Base64-encoded, not protected. It reinforces the importance of proper server-side access control and secure handling of authentication or sensitive information in real-world web applications.

## Tools
