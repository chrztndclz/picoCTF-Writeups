## Description
Can you get the flag?

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Go to this `website` and see what you can discover.

---

## Hints
- How is the password checked on this website?

---

## Analysis

The website checks the login information using JavaScript that runs in the browser instead of on the server. Because of this, anyone can open the developer tools and read the code to find the real username and password. Once the credentials in secure.js are found, logging in becomes easy and the flag is revealed.

---

## Methodology
**Step 1:** Open the challenge instance
Launch the provided website in your browser.


**Step 2:** Try default credentials (smoke test)

username: admin
password: admin

Result: Log In Failed — indicates credentials are not default.


**Step 3:** Open Developer Tools

In Chrome/Firefox: F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I.
Go to the Sources (Chrome) or Debugger (Firefox) tab.


Step 4: Locate site JavaScript files

In the list of loaded resources, find secure.js (or similarly named script referenced by the page).
Open secure.js in the sources/debugger view


Step 5: Inspect the JavaScript

Search inside secure.js for strings like "username", "password", "check", or any if conditions that compare a supplied password.
You will find the username/password hard-coded or the logic that verifies credentials.

Step 6: Extract credentials

From secure.js the credentials discovered were:

username: admin
password: strongPassword098765

Step 7: Log in with discovered credentials

Enter admin / strongPassword098765 into the login form and submit.

Step 8: Retrieve the flag

## Reflection

This challenge shows why you should never put real passwords or login checks in client-side code. Anyone can view JavaScript files and see the hidden credentials. Proper authentication should always be done on the server to keep it secure.
