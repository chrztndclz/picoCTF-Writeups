## Description

Can you get the flag?

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Go to this `website` and see what you can discover.

---

## Hints
- Is there more code than what the inspector initially shows?

---

## Analysis

This challenge hides different parts of the flag in separate files. The main HTML page doesn’t show everything, so you need to inspect the additional files included by the website—such as JavaScript and CSS. By checking these files in the browser’s developer tools, you can find the scattered flag pieces and combine them.

---

## Methodology
**Step 1:** Open the website and open Developer Tools (F12 or right-click → Inspect).
**Step 2:** Go to the Sources / Debugger tab and open script.js to find a part of the flag.

**Step 3:** Open the Style Editor and check style.css for another part of the flag.

**Step 4:** Combine all discovered flag fragments to form the full flag.

## Reflection

This challenge shows that websites often load extra files like JavaScript and CSS that users can freely view. Sensitive information should never be placed in these files because anyone can inspect them. It’s a reminder that security should always be handled on the server side, not hidden in client-side resources.

## Tools

Firefox Developer Tools – Another toolset for viewing website source files and debugging scripts.

Built-in HTML/JS/CSS Viewer – Lets you view all client-side resources that the website includes.
