## Description

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Go to this `website` and see what you can discover.

## Hints
- What is the web inspector in web browsers?

## Analysis

This challenge is simple: the flag is hidden directly in the HTML of the webpage. Since browsers allow you to inspect the structure of any website, using the web inspector reveals all the elements, comments, and text that may not be visible on the main page. By opening the DevTools and checking the page’s source, you can easily find the flag without needing to interact with any forms or scripts.

**Step 2:** Right-click the page and select Inspect (or press F12) to open the developer tools.
**Step 3:** Look through the HTML elements in the Elements tab to find the hidden flag.

## Reflection

This challenge teaches that anything inside the HTML can be viewed by anyone. Developers should never hide sensitive information directly in the page source because users can inspect or view the file at any time. It’s a reminder that security should never rely on obscurity, especially on the client side.
