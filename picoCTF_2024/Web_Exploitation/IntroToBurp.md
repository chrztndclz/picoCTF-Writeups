## Description

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Try here (http://titan.picoctf.net:59991/) to find the flag

---

## Hints
- Try using burpsuite to intercept request to capture the flag.
- Try mangling the request, maybe their server-side code doesn't handle malformed requests very well.

---

## Analysis

This challenge demonstrates how server-side input handling can break when receiving malformed or unexpected HTTP requests. Many applications parse headers, parameters, or methods incorrectly, and security testers use Burp Suite to exploit such weaknesses. By intercepting traffic, modifying parameters, or corrupting parts of the request, you can trigger the server to return debugging information—in this case, the flag.

## Methodology

**Step 1:** Start Burpsuite

**Step 2:** Ensure Burp is ready to intercept

Open Browser and paste the URL 

http://titan.picoctf.net:62396/

Turn On Intercept

Step 3: Submit any registration values

Fill the registration in the by any value (e.g admin) and click register

Step 4: Forward the requests

1st Forward

2nd Forward

3rd Forward

4th Forward

And then we got to the 2FA authentication but we don't know the OTP 

Step 5: Trigger the OTP validation request
On the OTP page, enter any random code—for example:

add random otp like "1234" and submit

Step 6: Remove the OTP parameter to bypass validation
Delete the line containing the OTP value in Burp:

you can see that we know have the otp=1234 

Remove the otp=1234 parameter from the intercepted request in Burp so that the OTP check becomes malformed, tricking the server into skipping its validation logic; then click Forward to send the modified request.

Step 7: Retrieve the flag

## Reflection

This challenge highlights how easily a server can leak sensitive information when it fails to properly validate malformed HTTP requests. Using Burp Suite to intercept and modify traffic demonstrates the importance of secure request parsing and how small changes in the request line or headers can expose internal behavior. It reinforces the value of manual testing when assessing web application security, since automated tools may miss simple parsing flaws that a tester can uncover by experimenting directly with raw HTTP requests.

## Tools

Burp Suite — intercepts and modifies HTTP(S) traffic; has Repeater, Intruder, Decoder, and other modules useful for manual web testing.
