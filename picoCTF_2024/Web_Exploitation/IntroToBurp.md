## Description

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Try here (http://titan.picoctf.net:59991/) to find the flag

---

## Hints
- Try using burpsuite to intercept request to capture the flag.
- Try mangling the request, maybe their server-side code doesn't handle malformed requests very well.

---

## Analysis

This challenge demonstrates how server-side input handling can break when receiving malformed or unexpected HTTP requests. Many applications parse headers, parameters, or methods incorrectly, and security testers use Burp Suite to exploit such weaknesses. By intercepting traffic, modifying parameters, or corrupting parts of the request, you can trigger the server to return debugging information—in this case, the flag.
