## Description

Do you know how to use the web inspector?

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Start searching `here` to find the flag

---

## Hints
- Use the web inspector on other files included by the web page.
- The flag may or may not be encoded

---

## Analysis

This challenge simply requires checking the hidden parts of a webpage using the browser inspector. The hint directs you to inspect other files included by the site, so exploring the About page’s HTML reveals a suspicious Base64-encoded string. Since the challenge says the flag might be encoded, decoding this string exposes the actual flag. The whole task is about knowing how to inspect page source and recognize encoded data.

---

## Methodology
**Step 1:** Inspect the all the websites pages

Home
About
Contact


**Step 2:** In the about page I say the sentence: 

"Try inspecting the page!! You might find it there"

Hinting that the flag could be here in this page. 

**Step 3:** Inspect the source code of the about me web page 

As it stated in the description the flag may or may not be encoded. 

In the section of the sentence I saw there's a strings format suspecting it as the flag.

Step 4: Use CyberChef to decode it from Base64 to a readable text.

## Reflection

The challenge shows how much information websites can hide in their source code. It reinforces the importance of inspecting HTML and recognizing common encodings like Base64. It’s a simple but valuable reminder that not everything is visible on the page, and checking behind the scenes often reveals what you need.

## Tools

Browser Inspector (F12) - Used to inspect HTML, scripts, and hidden encoded strings.

CyberChef - Decoded the Base64 string into readable text.
