## Description

I don't like scrolling down to read the code of my website, so I've squished it. As a bonus, my pages load faster!

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Hints
- Try CTRL+U / ⌘+U in your browser to view the page source. You can also add 'view-source:' before the URL, or try curl (URL) in your shell.
- Minification reduces the size of code, but does not change its functionality.
- What tools do developers use when working on a website? Many text editors and browsers include formatting.

## Analysis
The challenge involved a minified webpage where the flag was hidden within compressed HTML or script content. Since minification only removes whitespace without altering functionality, viewing the raw source code was enough to locate the flag. Using `curl` to fetch the page and `grep` to filter for the flag pattern made the process quick and efficient.

## Methodology

**Step 1:** Check the website

curl http://titan.picoctf.net:62481/

**Step 2:** Use grep to fetch the flag 

curl http://titan.picoctf.net:62481/ | grep "picoCTF"

**Step 3:** Retrieve the flag

## Reflection

This task reinforced how useful simple inspection tools are when dealing with web challenges. Even when code is compressed, it still contains readable strings, so checking the raw source is often the fastest solution. It also emphasized how command-line tools like `curl` and `grep` can streamline searching through web content.

---

## Tools

 **curl** – A command-line tool used to retrieve content from URLs. It allowed direct access to the raw HTML of the webpage.

**grep** – A text-searching tool used to filter output. It made it easy to search for the `picoCTF` flag pattern inside the retrieved HTML.
