## Analysis

## Methodology
**Step 1:** Connect to the service

nc tethys.picoctf.net 58286
The program immediately prints the two heap addresses, letting us measure the distance between them.

**Step 2:** Overflow input_data

Choose option 2:

Then enter a payload larger than 32 bytes:

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA


This overwrites safe_var.

Step 3: Check if safe_var != "bico" since base on the source code is this satisfied you'll get the flag 

Choose option 1:

**Step 4:** check the safe_var if modified 

Choose option 3:


<img width="489" height="90" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51e63cec-4ab8-4eb6-978c-1f45bbb8c435" />



**Step 5:** Since you confirmed that you satisfied the need to print the flag. Retrieve the flag. 

Choose option 4:

YOU WIN
